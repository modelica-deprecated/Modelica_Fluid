<p>
The library <b>Modelica_Fluid</b> is a <b>free</b> Modelica package provided under the
<A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_UsersGuide.html#Modelica_Fluid.UsersGuide.ModelicaLicense2"
>Modelica License 2</a>.
The library contains components describing
<b>1-dimensional thermo-fluid flow</b> in networks of pipes. A unique feature is that the
component equations and the media models
as well as pressure loss and heat transfer correlations are decoupled from each other.
All components are implemented such that they can be used for
media from the Modelica.Media library. This means especially that an
incompressible or compressible medium, a single or a multiple
substance medium with one or more phases might be used.
The goal is to include
the Modelica_Fluid library in the Modelica standard library as Modelica.Fluid.

<p>
The Modelica_Fluid library provides basic interfaces and
components to model 1-dimensional thermo-fluid flow in networks of pipes.
It is not the intention that this library covers all
application cases because the fluid flow area is too large and
because for special applications it is possible to implement
libraries with simpler component interfaces.
Instead, the goal is that the Modelica_Fluid library provides
a <b>reasonable set of components</b> and that it <b>demonstrates</b>
how to implement components of a fluid flow library in Modelica,
in particular to cope with difficult issues such as connector
design, reversing flow and initialization. It is planned to
include more components in the future. User proposals are
welcome.
</p>
<p>
This library has the following main features:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The connectors Modelica_Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort_a/_b are designed
     for one-dimensional flow of a <b>single substance</b>
     or of a <b>mixture of substances</b> with optional <b>multiple phases</b>.
     All media models from Modelica.Media can be utilized when
     connecting components. For one substance media, the additional arrays for
     multiple
     substance media have zero dimension and are therefore removed
     from the code during translation. The general connector definition
     therefore does not introduce an overhead for special cases.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> All the components of the Modelica_Fluid library are designed
     that they can be utilized for all media models from
     Modelica.Media if this is posssible. For example, all media can
     be utilized for the Modelica_Fluid.Sensors/Sources components.
     For some components only special media are possible, since additional
     functionality is required. For example,
     Modelica_Fluid.Components.Evaporator requires a two phase medium
     (extending from Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialTwoPhaseMedium).
     <br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> In order to simplify the initialization in the components,
     there is the restriction that only media models are supported
     that have T, (p,T), (p,h), (T,X), (p,T,X) or (p,h,X) as
     independent variables. Other media models would be possible,
     e.g., with (T,d) as independent variables. However, this requires
     to rewrite the code for the component initialization.
     (Note, T is temperature, p is pressure, d is density,
     h is specific enthalpy, and X is a mass fraction vector).
     <br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> All components work for <b>incompressible</b> and <b>compressible</b> media.
     This is implemented by a small change in the initialization of a
     component, if the medium is incompressible. Otherwise, the equations
     of the components are not influenced by this property.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> All components allow fluid flow in both directions, i.e.,
     <b>reversing flow</b> is supported. However, it is possible to declare that
     the flow through a component only has the design direction, in order to
     obtain faster simulation code.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> Two or more components can be connected together. This means that
     the pressures of all connected ports are equal and the mass flow rates
     sum up to zero. Specific enthalpy, mass fractions and trace substances are
     mixed according to the mass flow rates.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> The <b>momentum balance</b> and the <b>energy balance</b> are only fulfilled exactly if
     <b>two ports of equal diameter</b> are connected. In all other cases, the balances
     are approximated, because kinetic and friction effect are neglected. An explicit fitting
     or junction should be used if these are important for the specific problem at hand.
     In all circuits where friction dominates, or components such as pumps determine the flow rate,
     kinetic pressure is typically irrelevant. You can consider the
     <A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Examples_Explanatory.html#Modelica_Fluid.Examples.Explanatory.MomentumBalanceFittings"
>
     Modelica_Fluid.Examples.Explanatory.MomentumBalanceFittings</a> model (and its documentation)
     to see one case where the momentum balance essentially depends on kinetic pressure,
     so it is necessary to use explicit fittings in order to obtain correct results.
     <br>&nbsp;</li>
<li> Given the above-mentioned limitations, there is no restriction how components can be connected
     together. The resulting simulation performance however often strongly depends on the
     model structure and modeling assumptions made. In particular the direct connection of
     fluid volumes generally results in high-index DAEs for the pressures. The direct
     connection of flow models generally results in systems of implicit nonlinear algebraic
     equations.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h4><font color="#008000">Version 1.0, 2009-01-28</font></h4>

<p>
Modelica_Fluid was refactored and finalized for the release:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Refactoring of the code<br>
     This became necessary as the previous release Modelica_Fluid Streams Beta3
     still reflected the long development history, while the basic concepts had been crystalized.
     Please consult the subversion control (SVN) logs for individual changes.</li>

<li> Device oriented package names<br>
     The former sub-packages Junctions and PressureLosses have been combined into the new subpackage Fittings.
     The former Pumps and Volumes.SweptVolume have become the initial version of fluid Machines.
     The former Volumes package is now called Vessels.</li>

<li> Complete implementation of one-dimenstional fluid flow<br>
     The balance equations as documented in
     <A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_UsersGuide_ComponentDefinition.html#Modelica_Fluid.UsersGuide.ComponentDefinition.BalanceEquations"
>UsersGuide.ComponentDefinition.BalanceEquations</a>
     are now completely implemented. The implementations with generic boundary flow and source terms find in:
     <ul>
     <li><A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Interfaces.html#Modelica_Fluid.Interfaces.PartialDistributedVolume"
>Interfaces.PartialDistributedVolume</a>,
         <A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Interfaces.html#Modelica_Fluid.Interfaces.PartialLumpedVolume"
>Interfaces.PartialLumpedVolume</a>:
         Energy, Mass and Substance balances</li>
     <li><A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Interfaces.html#Modelica_Fluid.Interfaces.PartialDistributedFlow"
>Interfaces.PartialDistributedFlow</a>,
         <A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Interfaces.html#Modelica_Fluid.Interfaces.PartialLumpedFlow"
>Interfaces.PartialLumpedFlow</a>:
         Momentum balance</li>
     </ul>
     Specific models combine the balances and define the boundary flow and source terms as appropriate.
     For instance
     <ul>
     <li><A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Vessels.html#Modelica_Fluid.Vessels.OpenTank"
>Vessels.OpenTank</a> extends from
         <A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Interfaces.html#Modelica_Fluid.Interfaces.PartialLumpedVolume"
>Interfaces.PartialLumpedVolume</a>,</li>
     <li><A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Fittings.html#Modelica_Fluid.Fittings.SimpleGenericOrifice"
>Fittings.SimpleGenericOrifice</a> extends from
         <A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Interfaces.html#Modelica_Fluid.Interfaces.PartialLumpedFlow"
>Interfaces.PartialLumpedFlow</a>, besides
         <A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Interfaces.html#Modelica_Fluid.Interfaces.PartialTwoPortTransport"
>Interfaces.PartialTwoPortTransport</a>,</li>
     <li><A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Pipes.html#Modelica_Fluid.Pipes.DynamicPipe"
>Pipes.DynamicPipe</a> is based on
         <A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Interfaces.html#Modelica_Fluid.Interfaces.PartialDistributedVolume"
>Interfaces.PartialDistributedVolume</a> and
         <A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Interfaces.html#Modelica_Fluid.Interfaces.PartialDistributedFlow"
>Interfaces.PartialDistributedFlow</a>,
         besides <A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Interfaces.html#Modelica_Fluid.Interfaces.PartialTwoPort"
>Interfaces.PartialTwoPort</a>.</li>
     </ul>
     All non-trivial mass and energy balances of Vessels, Machines and Fittings have been replaced with PartialLumpedVolume.
     The mass and energy balances of Pipes are based on PartialDistributedVolume.<br>
     See <A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Examples.html#Modelica_Fluid.Examples.BranchingDynamicPipes"
>Examples.BranchingDynamicPipes</a>
     for an example utilizing the complete balance equations.

<li> New approach for the connection of distributed flow models<br>
     The staggered grid approach offers different choices for the connection approach. So far the preferred modeling was to put full mass balances
     into the pipes and expose half momentum balances through the ports (ModelStructure a_v_b).
     This resulted in nonlinear equation systems for pressure/flow correlations in connection sets.
     A new default ModelStructure av_vb has been introduced putting full momentum balances into the models and
     exposing half mass balances through the ports (av_vb replaces the former avb). This way the nonlinear equation systems are avoided.
     High-index DAEs need to be treated instead in connection sets.
     Alternatively a Fitting like SuddenExpansion can be introduced to account for different cross flow areas of connected flow models.</li>

<li> New Vessels.BaseClasses.PartialLumpedVessel treating the ports, including hydraulic resistances, for ClosedVolume, SimpleTank and SweptVolume.</li>

<li> Clarification of modeling assumptions<br>
     The documentation has been extended to better explain the modeling assumptions made. In particular the section
     <A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_UsersGuide_ComponentDefinition.html#Modelica_Fluid.UsersGuide.ComponentDefinition.FluidConnectors"
>UsersGuide.ComponentDefinition.FluidConnectors</a>
     now makes clear that the ports represent the thermodynamic enthalpy, as opposed to stagnation enthalpy,
     and thermodynamic or static pressure, as opposed to total pressure. An new package Explanatory has been added to the
     examples to show the difference beteen static pressure and total pressure and possible implications. See
     <A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Examples_Explanatory.html#Modelica_Fluid.Examples.Explanatory.MomentumBalanceFittings"
>Examples.Explanatory.MomentumBalanceFittings</a>.

<li> System (former Ambient)<br>
     The use of the global System object has been extended towards common default values for
     modeling assumptions, initialization, and advanced settings that are different for each application of the library
     but should nevertheless provide default values for reasons of convenience.
     In particular steady-state initialization and complete steady-state simulation can now be specified system-wide.
     A new Types.Init.Dynamics has been introduced, combining steady-state and initial conditions.
     The former Types.Init has become obsolete.
     <br>See <A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Examples.html#Modelica_Fluid.Examples.HeatingSystem"
>Examples.HeatingSystem</a></li>.

<li> Extension of pumps for better consideration of zero flow and heat transfer with environment<br>
     The simplified mass and energy balances have been replaced with a rigorous formulation.
     Moreover an optional heat transfer model can be configured for heat exchanged with the environment or the housing.<br>
     See <A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Machines_BaseClasses.html#Modelica_Fluid.Machines.BaseClasses.PartialPump"
>Machines.BaseClasses.PartialPump</a></li>

<li> Refinement of valves for flow reversal<br>
     All valves now use upstream discretization for reverting flow conditions.</li>

<li> Finalization of trace substrances<br>
     Modelica_Fluid now provides a sound implementation for trace substances,
     which can easily be added to existing Media models, in order to study their evolution in a fluid system.</li>
     <br>See <A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Examples_TraceSubstances.html#Modelica_Fluid.Examples.TraceSubstances.RoomCO2WithControls"
>Examples.TraceSubstances.RoomCO2WithControls</a></li>.

<li> Vectorized ports for volumes<br>
     The ports of models that typically have large volumes, like Vessels and Sources,
     have been vectorized. Formerly the connection of multiple flow models to the same port
     of such volume models resulted in unintended mixing equations for stream variables
     in connection sets outside the volumes. The mixing takes place inside the volumes
     when using multiple ports. Moreover a
     <A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Fittings.html#Modelica_Fluid.Fittings.MultiPort"
>Fittings.MultiPort</a>
     has been introduced. It can be attached to components like pipes,
     which don't have vectorized ports on their own.</li>

<li> Inverse parameterization of flow models with nominal operational conditions<br>
     Flow models have been added or extended to support the parameterization with nominal values
     (Machines.ControlledPump, Orifices.SimpleGenericOrifice, Pipes.BaseClasses.FlowModels.NominalTurbulentFlow).
     They are intended for early phases of system modeling, if geometries and flow characteristics
     are of secondary interest. As these models use the same interfaces, base classes and naming conventions,
     they can easily be replaced with more detailed models
     as more information shall be taken into account later on.<br>
     See <A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Examples.html#Modelica_Fluid.Examples.InverseParameterization"
>Examples.InverseParameterization</a></li>.

<li> Replaceable HeatTransfer models<br>
     The Vessels and the Machines now have replaceable HeatTransfer models,
     besides the Pipes. All HeatTransfer models are optional.
     The heat transfer models are parameterized with the Medium and the ThermodynamicState
     of involved flow segments.<br>
     See <A HREF="Modelica_Fluid_Interfaces.html#Modelica_Fluid.Interfaces.PartialHeatTransfer"
>Interfaces.PartialHeatTransfer</a>.

<li> All examples are working now (using Dymola 7.1).<br>
     The number of examples has been extended with the former critical test cases
     HeatingSystem and IncompressibleFluidNetwork. Moreover the HeatExchangers have been
     moved into Examples.</li>

</ul>


<h4><font color="#008000">Version 1.0 Streams Beta 3, 2008-10-12</font></h4>

<p>
Modelica_Fluid was further improved:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Volumes, tanks, junctions<br>
     Added asserts to require that ports are connected at most once.
     If a user would perform more than one connection, ideal mixing
     takes place for the connected components and this is nearly never
     what the user would like to have </li>

<li> Ambient<br>
     Renamed Ambient to System, including adaptation of models.<br>
     Introduced default values system.flowDirection and
     as a comment system.initType. system.flowDirection is used in
     two port components as default.</li>

<li> GenericJunction<br>
     Corrected specification of flowDirection.<br>
     Added a HeatPort.</li>

<li> PartialDistributedFlow models<br>
     Adapted determination of velocities to usage of
     upstream properties at ports.<br>
     Corrected and unified initialization of p_start[*] values.<li>

<li> DistributedPipe models<br>
     Changed treatment of port densities and viscosities
     to the treatment of the lumped pipe model. This way events are
     avoided if the mass flow rate crosses or approaches zero.<br>
     Correct determination of Reynolds numbers.<br>
     Added test model DistributedPipeClosingValve.</li>

<li> ControlValves<br>
     Changed flowCharacteristic into valveCharacteristic<br>
     Removed parameter Kv and added dp_nom, m_flow_nom from linear
     and discrete valve interfaces. Added test cases.<br>
     Adapted Examples to new LinearValve and DiscreteValve,
     using nominal values instead of Kv. <br>
     Changed default flow coefficient selection to OpPoint<li>

<li> Fixed units for Kv and Cv in control valve models.</li>

<li> Updated tests for valves.</li>

<li> Bug in Modelica_Fluid.Test.TestComponents.Pumps.TestWaterPump2 corrected
     (complicated redeclaration issue).</li>

<li> Adapted AST_BatchPlant so that "Check" is sucessful.
     Simulation fails after 600 s.</li>

<li> Introduced
     density_pTX(Medium.p_default, Medium.T_default, Medium.X_default)
     as default value for nominal densities (previously it was a literal
     such as 1000).</li>

<li> Pumps<br>
     Updated energy balance equations for pumps (no division by zero anymore,
     fixed several bugs related to Np).<br>
     Added two more test cases for pumps.<br>
     Fixed pump initialization options.</li>

<li> PartialPump<br>
     Explanation for the energy balanced added as comment<br>
     "h=0" replaced by "h=Medium.h_default" since otherwise an assert is triggered
     if "h=0" is not in the medium range.<br>
     Fluid ports positioned in the middle line
     and using the same size as for all other components.</li>

<li> Pumps.Pump <br>
     Resized input connector, so that it has the same size as the
     standard input connectors.<br>
     Changed icon text to input connector to "N_in [rpm]".<br>
     Added unit 1/min to the external and internal input connector.</li>

<li> PartialValve<br>
     fillcolor=white added to icon<br>
     made line Thickness = Single,
     since icon does not look nice sometimes</li>

<li> All components<br>
     Changed %name color from black to blue
     (is a conversion bug, since Modelica 2 has blue as default
     color whereas Modelica 3 has black and Dymola is not
     taking care off this).</li>

<li> Sources<br>
     Made icon elements unvisible, if corresponding input is disabled.</li>

<li> Valves, Pipes, PressureLosses, HeatExchangers, two port senors<br>
     Added an arrow in the icon for the "design flow direction" from
     port_a to port_b.</li>

<li> Moved default initialization in "System" in to a comment, since no effect yet</li>

<li> Added the explanation from Francesco for Kv, Cv for valves in the
     users guide and added links in the corresponding valves to this description</li>
</ul>

<p>
"Check" for the library is successful. "Check with Simulation"
(i.e., simulating all test models in the library) is successful
with the exceptions:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Examples.AST_BatchPlant.BatchPlant_StandardWater<br>
     Need to be fixed in a later release (requires quite a lot of work).</li>
<li> Test.TestOverdeterminedSteadyStateInit.Test5<br>
     Test.TestOverdeterminedSteadyStateInit.Test6<br>
     These are test cases where too much initial conditions are given.
     The goal is to work on methods how this can be handled.
     So, this is a principal problem that these models do not simulate.</li>
</ul>



<h4><font color="#008000">Version 1.0 Streams Beta 2, 2008-10-08</font></h4>

<p>
Modelica_Fluid was transformed to Modelica 3 and to Modelica Standard
library 3.0 (by automatic conversion). Further changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Emulated enumerations changed to real enumerations.</li>
<li> Improved ControlValves code</li>
<li> Introduced stream connectors with stream keyword (was previously an annotation)</li>
<li> Introduced inStream() instead of inflow() </li>
<li> Introduced m_flow*actualStream(h_outflow) instead of
     streamFlow() or semiLinear(m_flow, inStream(h_outflow), medium.h)</li>
<li> Removed Modelica_Fluid.Media and all references to it (since now available
     in Modelica.Media of MSL3.0).</li>
<li> Fixed PartialLumpedVolume for media with multiple substances</li>
<li> New function "Utilities.RegFun3" for regularization with static head</li>
<li> Fix density in static head models with the new RegFun3 functions
     (ticket 7)</li>
<li> Minor bug in MixingVolume corrected:<br>
     V_lumped and Wb_flow have been set as modifiers when extending from PartialLumpedVolume,
     although they are not declared as input. This is not allowed in Modelica 3.
     Fixed by replacing the modifiers by equations.</li>
<li> Modelica_Fluid.Sources.FixedBoundary<br>
     Introduced p_default, T_default, h_default as default values, since
     otherwise warnings will always be printed because parameter value is missing.</li>
<li> Modelica_Fluid.Sources.Boundary_pT<br>
     Modelica_Fluid.Sources.Boundary_ph<br>
     Modelica_Fluid.Sources.MassFlowSource_T<br>
     Changed default values of parameters reference_p, reference_T to
     p_default, T_default (some have been xx_default, some reference_xx,
     it seems best to always use the same approach)</li>
<li> Modelica_Fluid.Pipes.BaseClasses.PartialDistributedFlow<br>
     Added default value for parameter "rho_nominal" =

<li> Introduced HeatPorts with vectorized icon in Modelica_Fluid.Interfaces</li>
<li> Deleted Modelica_Fluid.WorkInProgress since it seems to be too much work
     to convert it to stream connectors</li>
<li> Added Modelica_Fluid.Media (contains ConstantLiquidWater
     medium because functions are missing in Modelica.Media),<lI>
<li> Added two additional test cases with LumpedPipes
    (to identify problems with hierarchically connected stream connectors).</li>
<li> Deleted TestPortVolumes since PortVolumes can no longer be implemented with
     stream connectors</li>
<li> Leakage flow introduced for valves</li>

<li> Changed default value of leackage flow of valves to zero.</li>
<li> Fixed Modelica_Fluid.Junctions.MassFlowRatio so that it compiles
     (inflow(..) currently only supported for scalars, not for vectors)</li>
<li> Added script libraryinfo.mos, in order that Modelica_Fluid appears in the
     Dymola library window automatically (provided library is in MODELICAPATH)</li>
<li> Replaced semiLinear(..) by streamFlow(..) (not yet at all places)</li>
<li> Introduced check-boxes in parameter menu of Sources (is more convenient to use)</li>
<li> TwoPortTransport<br>
     Computation of V_flow and optionally port_a_T, port_b_T.
     Error in temperature calculation corrected</li>
<li> Tank:<br>

from a library that could be included in the Modelica
standard library.
</p>
<h4><font color="#008000">Previous Releases</font></h4>
<ul>
<li><i>Oct., 2003</i><br>
       by Martin Otter: Adapted to latest design of the Modelica.Media
       library.<br>
       by Ruediger Franke: Included sensor components and
       Modelica_Fluid.Examples.DrumBoiler example.</li>
<li><i>Sept., 2003</i><br>
       by Martin Otter: Changes according to the decisions of the
       Modelica design meeting in Dearborn, Sept. 2-4, 2003.
       Fluid library splitt in to two packages: Modelica.Media
       that contains the media models and Modelica_Fluid that
       contains fluid flow components. Modelica.Media is
       independent of Modelica_Fluid and my be used also from
       other packages that may have a different design as
       Modelica_Fluid.
<li><i>Aug., 2003</i><br>
       by Martin Otter: Improved documentation, PortVicinity (now called semiLinear)
       manually expanded, two different volume types,
       replaced number of massFractions from n to n-1 in order
       that usage of model for single substances is easier
       and in order that no special cases have to be treated
       in the equations (previously the massFraction equations had to
       be removed for single substance flow; now they are removed
       automatically, since the dimensions are zero, and not one
       as previously), included asserts to check the validity of
       the medium models, included the dynamic viscosity in the
       medium models, adapted the examples and medium models to the
       changes in Interfaces, improved menus according to the new
       features in Dymola 5.1. Added "Components.ShortPipe" that
       contains a detailed model of the frictional losses in pipes
       over a very wide range.</li>
<li><i>Feb., 2003</i><br>
       by Martin Otter: Included several elementary components and
       a model for moisted air. Some elementary components, such as
       FixedAmbient, are adapted versions from the SimpleFlow fluid library
       of Anton Haumer.</li>
<li><i>Dec., 2002</i><br>
       by Hubertus Tummescheit:
       Improved version of the high precision water model
       (Copy from ThermoFluid library, code reorganization,
       enhanced documentation, additional functions).</li>
<li><i>Nov. 30, 2002</i><br>
       by Martin Otter: Improved the design from the design meeting:
       Adapted to Modelica standard library 1.5,
       added "choicesAllMatching=true" annotation,
       added short documentation to "Interfaces",
       added packages "Examples" and "Media" (previously called "Properties")
       from previous versions and adapted them to the updated
       "Interfaces" package.</li>
<li><i>Nov. 20-21, 2002</i><br>
       by Hilding Elmqvist, Mike Tiller, Allan Watson, John Batteh, Chuck Newman,
       Jonas Eborn: Improved at the 32nd Modelica Design Meeting.</li>

<b>Using or Distributing a Modelica <U>Package</U> under the Modelica License 2</b></P>

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0pt"><B>What are the main
differences to the previous version of the Modelica License?</B></P>
<OL>
        <LI>
        Modelica License 1 is unclear whether the licensed Modelica package
        can be distributed under a different license. Version 2 explicitly
        allows that &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo; can be distributed under
        any license of Your choice, see examples in Section 1d) as to what
        qualifies as Derivative Work (so, version 2 is clearer).</LI>
        <LI>
        If You modify a Modelica package under Modelica License 2 (besides
        fixing of errors, adding vendor specific Modelica annotations, using
        a subset of the classes of a Modelica package, or using another
        representation, e.g., a binary representation), you must rename the
        root-level name of the package for your distribution. In version 1
        you could keep the name (so, version 2 is more restrictive). The
        reason of this restriction is to reduce the risk that Modelica
        packages are available that have identical names, but different
        functionality.</LI>
        <LI>
        Modelica License 1 states that &ldquo;It is not allowed to charge a
        fee for the original version or a modified version of the software,
        besides a reasonable fee for distribution and support<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&ldquo;.
        Version 2 has a </SPAN>similar intention for all Original Work under
        <U>Modelica License 2</U> (to remain free of charge and open source)
        but states this more clearly as &ldquo;No fee, neither as a
        copyright-license fee, nor as a selling fee for the copy as such may
        be charged&rdquo;. Contrary to version 1, Modelica License 2 has no
        restrictions on fees for Derivative Work that is provided under a
        different license (so, version 2 is clearer and has fewer
        restrictions).</LI>
        <LI>
        Modelica License 2 introduces several useful provisions for the
        licensee (articles 5, 6, 12), and for the licensor (articles 7, 12,
        13, 14) that have no counter part in version 1.</LI>
        <LI>
        Modelica License 2 can be applied to all type of work, including
        documents, images and data files, contrary to version 1 that was
        dedicated for software only (so, version 2 is more general).</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) as part of my commercial
Modelica modeling and simulation environment?</B></P>
<P>Yes,
according to Section 2c). However, you are not allowed to charge a
fee for this part of your environment. Of course, you can charge for
your part of the environment.
</P>

<P><B>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different
license?</B></P>
<P>No.
The license of an unmodified Modelica package cannot be changed
according to Sections 2c) and 2d). This means that you cannot <U>sell</U>
copies of it, any distribution has to be free of charge.</P>

<P><B>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different license
when I first encrypt the package?</B></P>
<P>No.
Merely encrypting a package does not qualify for Derivative Work and
therefore the encrypted package has to stay under Modelica License 2.</P>


<P><B>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different license
when I first add classes to the package?</B></P>
<P>No.
The package itself remains unmodified, i.e., it is Original Work, and
therefore the license for this part must remain under Modelica
License 2. The newly added classes can be, however, under a different
license.
</P>

<P><B>Can
I copy a class out of a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2)
and include it </B><U><B>unmodified</B></U><B> in a Modelica package
under a </B><U><B>commercial/proprietary license</B></U><B>?</B></P>
<P>No,
according to article 2c). However, you can include model, block,
function, package, record and connector classes in your Modelica
package under <U>Modelica License 2</U>. This means that your
Modelica package could be under a commercial/proprietary license, but
one or more classes of it are under Modelica License 2.<BR>Note, a
&ldquo;type&rdquo; class (e.g., type Angle = Real(unit=&rdquo;rad&rdquo;))
can be copied and included unmodified under a commercial/proprietary
license (for details, see the next question).</P>

<P><B>Can
I copy a type class or </B><U><B>part</B></U><B> of a model, block,
function, record, connector class, out of a Modelica package (under
Modelica License 2) and include it modified or unmodified in a
Modelica package under a </B><U><B>commercial/proprietary</B></U><B>
license</B></P>
<P>Yes,
according to article 2d), since this will in the end usually qualify
as Derivative Work. The reasoning is the following: A type class or
part of another class (e.g., an equation, a declaration, part of a
class description) cannot be utilized &ldquo;by its own&rdquo;. In
order to make this &ldquo;usable&rdquo;, you have to add additional
code in order that the class can be utilized. This is therefore
usually Derivative Work and Derivative Work can be provided under a
different license. Note, this only holds, if the additional code
introduced is sufficient to qualify for Derivative Work. Merely, just
copying a class and changing, say, one character in the documentation
of this class would be no Derivative Work and therefore the copied
code would have to stay under Modelica License 2.</P>

<P><B>Can
I copy a class out of a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2)
and include it in </B><U><B>modified </B></U><B>form in a
</B><U><B>commercial/proprietary</B></U><B> Modelica package?</B></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0pt; font-weight: medium">Yes.
If the modification can be seen as a &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo;,
you can place it under your commercial/proprietary license. If the
modification does not qualify as &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo; (e.g.,
bug fixes, vendor specific annotations), it must remain under
Modelica License 2. This means that your Modelica package could be
under a commercial/proprietary license, but one or more parts of it
are under Modelica License 2.</P>

<P><B>Can I distribute a
&ldquo;save total model&rdquo; under my commercial/proprietary
license, even if classes under Modelica License 2 are included?</B></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0pt; font-weight: medium">Your
classes of the &ldquo;save total model&rdquo; can be distributed
under your commercial/proprietary license, but the classes under
Modelica License 2 must remain under Modelica License 2. This means
you can distribute a &ldquo;save total model&rdquo;, but some parts
might be under Modelica License 2.</P>

<P><B>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) in encrypted form?</B></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0pt; font-weight: medium">Yes.
Note, if the encryption does not allow &ldquo;copying&rdquo; of
classes (in to unencrypted Modelica source code), you have to send
the Modelica source code of this package to your customer, if he/she
wishes it, according to article&nbsp;6.</P>

<P><B>Can I distribute an
executable under my commercial/proprietary license, if the model from
which the executable is generated uses models from a Modelica package
under Modelica License 2?</B></P>
<P>Yes,
according to article 2d), since this is seen as Derivative Work. The
reasoning is the following: An executable allows the simulation of a
concrete model, whereas models from a Modelica package (without
pre-processing, translation, tool run-time library) are not able to
be simulated without tool support. By the processing of the tool and
by its run-time libraries, significant new functionality is added (a
model can be simulated whereas previously it could not be simulated)
and functionality available in the package is removed (e.g., to build
up a new model by dragging components of the package is no longer
possible with the executable).</P>

<P><B>Is my modification to
a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) a Derivative Work?</B></P>
<P>It
is not possible to give a general answer to it. To be regarded as &quot;an
original work of authorship&quot;, a derivative work must be
different enough from the original or must contain a substantial
amount of new material. Making minor changes or additions of little
substance to a preexisting work will not qualify the work as a new
version for such purposes.

<P>Yes.
Extracting information from a Modelica package, and providing it in a
human readable, suitable format, like html, doc or pdf format, where
the content is significantly modified (e.g. tables with interface
information are constructed from the declarations of the public
variables) qualifies as Derivative Work and there are no restrictions

<P>Yes.
In case you distribute your document, the copied parts are still
under Modelica License 2 and you are not allowed to charge a license
fee for this part. You can, of course, charge a fee for the rest of
your document.</P>

<P><B>Can

the creation of Derivative Works is allowed. In case the content is

alternative 2d).</P>

<P><B>Can I sell a printed
version of a Modelica document (under Modelica License 2), e.g., the
Modelica Language Specification?</B></P>
<P>No,
if you are not the copyright-holder, since article 2c) does not allow
a selling fee for a (in this case physical) copy. However, mere
printing and shipping costs may be recovered.</P>

<p>
The development of this library has been a collaborative effort
and many have contributed.
</p>
<ul>
<li> The previous design of this library (until beginning of 2008) was based on the paper
     Elmqvist H., Tummescheit H., and Otter M.:
     <a href="http://www.modelica.org/events/Conference2003/papers/h40_Elmqvist_fluid.pdf">
     Object-Oriented Modeling of Thermo-Fluid Systems</a>.
     Modelica 2003 Conference, Link&ouml;ping, Sweden, pp. 269-286, Nov. 3-4, 2003.<br>
     This design has been partly changed, especially by the introduction of the streams
     concept.</li>

<li> The Fluid library development was organized in 2002-2004 by Martin
     Otter, since 2004 it is organized by Francesco Casella, and
     since 2008 it is organized jointly by Francesco Casella and R&uuml;diger Franke.</li>

<li> Francesco Casella included several components of his ThermoPower
     library with some rewriting. The stream connector concept used in Modelica_Fluid is
     based on a similar concept developed by him for the ThermoPower library.</li>

<li> R&uuml;diger Franke initiated the stream connector concept as an extension
     and improved version of the ThermoPower concept. In Nov. 2008 - Jan. 2009 he
     greatly restructured and improved the library.<li>

<li> Michael Wetter introduced trace constituents in Modelica_Fluid consistently and
     provided corresponding examples under Examples.TraceSubstances.</li>

<li> The following people contributed to the fluid component models,
     examples, and the further design of the library
     (alphabetical list):<br>
