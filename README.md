# Modelica_Fluid Library

Free library from the Modelica Association providing components to model 1-dimensional thermo-fluid flow in networks of vessels, pipes, fluid machines, valves and fittings. This library is included in the Modelica Standard Library since version 3.1.

## Library description

The `Modelica_Fluid` library contains components describing 1-dimensional thermo-fluid flow in networks of vessels, pipes, fluid machines, valves and fittings. A unique feature is that the component equations and the media models as well as pressure loss and heat transfer correlations are decoupled from each other. All components are implemented such that they can be used for media from the Modelica.Media library. This means especially that an incompressible or compressible medium, a single or a multiple substance medium with one or more phases might be used. The goal is to include the Modelica_Fluid library in the Modelica standard library as Modelica.Fluid. This is version 1.0 of the `Modelica_Fluid` library. With respect to previous versions of the `Modelica_Fluid` library, the design of the connectors has been changed, using the recently developed concept of streams connectors.

#### Release notes

* [Version v1.0 (2009-02-03)](../../archive/v1.0.zip)
  * With respect to previous versions of the `Modelica_Fluid` library, the design of the connectors has been changed, using the recently developed concept of streams connectors. This requires an extension to the Modelica specification which will be included in Modelica 3.1.
